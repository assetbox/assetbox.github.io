# Asset that already exists

Duplicate management is performed by analyzing the assets that existed in the existing project.  
You can check and delete things that are duplicated but have no effect on deletion.


## Step 1

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm" default>

```sh
$ pnpm assetbox manage
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```sh
$ yarn assetbox manage
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```sh
$ npm run assetbox manage
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Step 2
Select `Duplicated Assets` in the left sidebar.  

Examples of `picture.svg` and `gallery.svg` are the same files, but exist as different files.

## Step 3
When I choose to delete `picture.svg`, I can see that it is being used by `App.tsx`, and when I hover the mouse, I can see which line is being used.

## Step 4
When I choose to delete `gallery.svg`, I can judge that there is nothing I use. We recommend that you delete the file.
