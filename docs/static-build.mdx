# Static Build

Deploying static files in places such as s3 allows designers and developers to share the asset that exists in the project. It's like an in-house icon viewer.

Create a static file in the `assetbox.config.cjs` file based on the `category`.
Build output folder is `assetbox-dist`

In this case, the administrative portion is lost and replaced with read-only.
Can be used as an icon viewer

## Setup

```js twoslash title='assetbox.config.cjs'
/**
 * @type {import('@assetbox/cli').AssetBoxScheme}
 */
const config = {
  ...
  staticBuild: {
    /**
      Build Output Folder

      Default value is "assetbox-dist"
    */
    outDir: "assetbox-dist",
    /**
      base path for both static resources and routing in a web application.

      Default value is "/"
    */
    base: "/",
    /**
      mode: "library" will change the asset name to camelCase.
      clicking on the asset will copy the asset name to the clipboard.
      Recommended for use with `icon-build`.

      Default value is "app"
    */
    mode: "library" // or "app"
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```
